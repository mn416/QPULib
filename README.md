# QPULib

Version 0.1.0.

QPULib is a programming language and compiler for the [Raspberry
Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)'s *Quad Processing Units* (QPUs).
It is implemented as a C++ library that runs on the Pi's ARM CPU,
generating and offloading programs to the QPUs at runtime.  This page
introduces and documents QPULib.  For build instructions, see the
[Getting Started Guide](Doc/GettingStarted.md).

## Background

The
[QPU](http://www.broadcom.com/docs/support/videocore/VideoCoreIV-AG100-R.pdf)
is a [vector
processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_processor) developed by
[Broadcom](http://www.broadcom.com/) with
instructions that operate on 16-element vectors of 32-bit integer or
floating point values.
For example, given two 16-element vectors

`10 11 12 13` `14 15 16 17` `18 19 20 21` `22 23 24 25`

and

`20 21 22 23` `24 25 26 27` `28 29 30 31` `32 33 34 35`

the QPU's *integer-add* instruction computes a third vector

`30 32 34 36` `38 40 42 44` `46 48 50 52` `54 56 58 60`

where each element in the output is the sum of the
corresponding two elements in the inputs.

Each 16-element vector is comprised of four *quads*.  This is where
the name "Quad Processing Unit" comes from: a QPU processes one quad
per clock cycle, and a QPU instruction takes four consecutive clock
cycles to deliver a full 16-element result vector.

The Pi contains 12 QPUs in total, each running at 250MHz.  That's a
max throughput of 750M vector instructions per second (250M cycles
divided by 4 cycles-per-instruction times 12 QPUs).  Or: 12B
operations per second (750M instructions times 16 vector elements).
QPU instructions can in some cases deliver two results at a
time, so the Pi's QPUs are often advertised at 24
[GFLOPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS).

The QPUs are part of the Raspberry Pi's graphics pipeline.  If you're
interested in doing efficient graphics on the Pi then you probably
want [OpenGL
ES](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/demos/hello-teapot.md).
But if you'd like to try accellerating a non-graphics part of your Pi
project then QPULib is worth a look.  (And so too are
[these references](#user-content-references).)

## Example 1: Euclid's Algorithm

Following tradition, let's start by implementing [Euclid's
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm).  Given
a pair of positive integers larger then zero, Euclid's algorithm
computes the largest integer that divides into both without a
remainder, also known as the *greatest common divisor*, or GCD for
short.

We present two versions of the algorithm:

  1. a **scalar** version that runs on the ARM CPU and computes a
     single GCD; and

  2. a **vector** version that runs on a single QPU and computes 16
     different GCDs in parallel.

### Scalar version

In plain C++, we can express the algorithm as follows.

```C++
void gcd(int* p, int* q, int* r)
{
  int a = *p;
  int b = *q;
  while (a != b) {
    if (a > b) 
      a = a-b;
    else
      b = b-a;
  }
  *r = a;
}
```

Admittedly, it's slightly odd to write `gcd` in this way, operating
on pointers to integers rather than integers directly.  However, it
prepares the way for the vector version which operates on 
*arrays* of inputs and outputs.

### Vector version 1

Using QPULib, the algorithm looks as follows.

```c++
#include <QPULib.h>

void gcd(Ptr<Int> p, Ptr<Int> q, Ptr<Int> r)
{
  Int a = *p;
  Int b = *q;
  While (any(a != b))
    Where (a > b)
      a = a-b;
    End
    Where (a < b)
      b = b-a;
    End
  End
  *r = a;
}
```

Even this simple example introduces a number of concepts:

  * the `Int` type denotes a 16-element vector of 32-bit integers;

  * the `Ptr<Int>` type denotes a 16-element vector of *addresses* of
    `Int` vectors;

  * the expression `*p` denotes the `Int` vector in memory starting at address
    <tt>p<sub>0</sub></tt>, i.e. starting at the *first* address in the
    vector `p`;

  * the expression `a != b` computes a vector of booleans via a 
    pointwise comparison of vectors `a` and `b`;

  * the condition `any(a != b)` is true when *any* of the booleans in the
    vector `a != b` are true;

  * the statement `Where (a > b) a = a-b; End` is a conditional assigment:
    only elements in vector `a` for which `a > b` holds will be
    modified.

It's worth reiterating that QPULib is just standard C++ code: there
are no pre-processors being used other than the standard C
pre-processor.  All the QPULib language constructs are simply
classes, functions, and macros exported by QPULib.  This kind of
language is somtimes known as a [Domain Specific Embedded
Language](http://cs.yale.edu/c2/images/uploads/dsl.pdf).

### Invoking the QPUs

Now, to compute 16 GCDs on a single QPU, we write the following
program.

```c++
int main()
{
  // Compile the gcd function to a QPU kernel k
  auto k = compile(gcd);

  // Allocate and initialise arrays shared between CPU and QPUs
  SharedArray<int> a(16), b(16), r(16);

  // Initialise inputs to random values in range 100..199
  srand(0);
  for (int i = 0; i < 16; i++) {
    a[i] = 100 + rand()%100;
    b[i] = 100 + rand()%100;
  }

  // Set the number of QPUs to use
  k.setNumQPUs(1);

  // Invoke the kernel
  k(&a, &b, &r);

  // Display the result
  for (int i = 0; i < 16; i++)
    printf("gcd(%i, %i) = %i\n", a[i], b[i], r[i]);
  
  return 0;
}
```

Unpacking this a bit:

  * `compile` takes function defining a QPU computation and returns a
    CPU-side handle that can be used to invoke it;

  * the handle `k` is of type `Kernel<Ptr<Int>, Ptr<Int>,
    Ptr<Int>>`, capturing the types of `gcd`'s parameters,
    but we use the `auto` keyword to avoid clutter;

  * when the kernel is invoked by writing `k(&a, &b, &r)`, QPULib knows
    how to automatically convert CPU values of type
    `SharedArray<int>*` into QPU values of type `Ptr<Int>`;

  * the <tt>SharedArray&lt;&alpha;&gt;</tt> type is used to allocate
    memory that is accessed
    by both the CPU and the QPUs: memory allocated with `new` and
    `malloc()` will not be accessible from the QPUs.

Running this program, we get:

```
gcd(183, 186) = 3
gcd(177, 115) = 1
gcd(193, 135) = 1
gcd(186, 192) = 6
gcd(149, 121) = 1
gcd(162, 127) = 1
gcd(190, 159) = 1
gcd(163, 126) = 1
gcd(140, 126) = 14
gcd(172, 136) = 4
gcd(111, 168) = 3
gcd(167, 129) = 1
gcd(182, 130) = 26
gcd(162, 123) = 3
gcd(167, 135) = 1
gcd(129, 102) = 3
```

### Vector version 2: loop unrolling

[Loop unrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_unrolling) is a
technique for improving performance by reducing the number of costly
branch instructions executed.

The QPU's branch instruction can indeed be costly: it requires three
[delay slots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_slot) (that's 12
clock cycles), and QPULib currently makes no attempt to fill these
slots with useful work.  Although QPULib doesn't do loop unrolling
for you, it does make it easy to express: we can simply
use a C++ loop to generate multiple QPU statements.

```c++
void gcd(Ptr<Int> p, Ptr<Int> q, Ptr<Int> r)
{
  Int a = *p;
  Int b = *q;
  While (any(a != b))
    // Unroll the loop body 32 times
    for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
      Where (a > b)
        a = a-b;
      End
      Where (a < b)
        b = b-a;
      End
    }
  End
  *r = a;
}
```

Using C++ as a meta-language in this way is one of the attractions
of QPULib.  We will see lots more examples of this later!

## Example 2: 3D Rotation

Let's move to another simple example that helps to introduce
ideas: a routine to rotate 3D objects.

(Of course, [OpenGL
ES](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/demos/hello-teapot.md)
would be a much better path for doing efficient graphics; this is just
for illustration purposes.)

### Scalar version

The following function will rotate `n` vertices about the Z axis by
&theta; degrees.

```c++
void rot3D(int n, float cosTheta, float sinTheta, float* x, float* y)
{
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    float xOld = x[i];
    float yOld = y[i];
    x[i] = xOld * cosTheta - yOld * sinTheta;
    y[i] = yOld * cosTheta + xOld * sinTheta;
  }
}
```

If we apply this to the vertices in [Newell's
teapot](https://github.com/rm-hull/newell-teapot/blob/master/teapot)
(rendered using [Richard Hull's
wireframes](https://github.com/rm-hull/wireframes) tool)

<img src="Doc/teapot.png" alt="Newell's teapot" width=30%>

with &theta; = 180 degrees, then we get

<img src="Doc/teapot180.png" alt="Newell's teapot" width=30%>

### Vector version 1

Our first vector version is almost identical to the scalar version
above: the only difference is that each loop iteration now processes
16 vertices at a time rather than a single vertex.

```c++
void rot3D(Int n, Float cosTheta, Float sinTheta, Ptr<Float> x, Ptr<Float> y)
{
  For (Int i = 0, i < n, i = i+16)
    Float xOld = x[i];
    Float yOld = y[i];
    x[i] = xOld * cosTheta - yOld * sinTheta;
    y[i] = yOld * cosTheta + xOld * sinTheta;
  End
}
```

Unfortunately, this simple solution is not the most efficient: it will
spend a lot of time blocked on the memory subsystem, waiting for
vector loads and stores to complete.  To get good performance on a
QPU, it is desirable to overlap memory access with computation, and
the current QPULib compiler is not clever enough to do this
automatically.  We can however solve the problem manually, using
*non-blocking* load and store operations.

### Vector version 2: non-blocking loads and stores

QPULib supports non-blocking loads through two functions:

  * Given a vector of addresses `p`, the
    statement `gather(p)` will *request* 
    the value at each address in `p`.

  * A subsequent a call to `receive(x)`, where `x` is vector,
    will block until the value at each address in
    `p` has been loaded into `x`.

Unlike the statement `x = *p`, the statement `gather(p)` will request
the value *at each address* in `p`, not the vector beginning at the
first address in `p`.  In addition, `gather(p)` does not
block until the loads have completed: between `gather(p)`
and `receive(x)` the program is free to perform computation *in
parallel* with the slow memory accesses.

Inside the QPU, an 4-element FIFO is used to hold `gather`
requests: each call to `gather` will enqueue the FIFO, and each call
to `receive` will dequeue it.  This means that a maximum of four
`gather` calls may be issued before a `receive` must be called.

Non-blocking stores are not as powerfull, but they are
still useful:

  * Given vector of addresses `p` and a vector `x`,
    the statement `store(x, p)` will write
    vector `x` to memory beginning at the first address in `p`.

Unlike the statement `*p = x`, the statement `store(p, x)` will not
wait until `x` has been written.  However, any subsequent call to
`store` will wait until the previous store has completed.  (Future
improvements to QPULib could allow several outstanding stores instead of
just one.)

We are now ready to implement a vectorised rotation routine that
overlaps memory access with computation:

```c++
void rot3D(Int n, Float cosTheta, Float sinTheta, Ptr<Float> x, Ptr<Float> y)
{
  // Function index() returns vector <0 1 2 ... 14 15>
  Ptr<Float> p = x + index();
  Ptr<Float> q = y + index();
  // Pre-fetch first two vectors
  gather(p); gather(q);

  Float xOld, yOld;
  For (Int i = 0, i < n, i = i+16)
    // Pre-fetch two vectors for the *next* iteration
    gather(p+16); gather(q+16);
    // Receive vectors for *this* iteration
    receive(xOld); receive(yOld);
    // Store results
    store(xOld * cosTheta - yOld * sinTheta, p);
    store(yOld * cosTheta + xOld * sinTheta, q);
    p = p+16; q = q+16;
  End

  // Discard pre-fetched vectors from final iteration
  receive(xOld); receive(yOld);
}
```

While the outputs from one iteration are being computed and written to
memory, the inputs for the *next* iteration are being loaded *in
parallel*.

### Vector version 3: multiple QPUs

QPULib provides a simple mechanism to execute the same kernel on
multiple QPUs in parallel: before invoking a kernel `k`, call
`k.setNumQPUs(n)` to use `n` QPUs.
For this to be useful the programmer needs a way to tell
each QPU to compute a different part of the overall result.
Accordingly,
QPULib provides the `me()` function which returns the unique id of the
QPU that called it.  More specifically, `me()` returns a vector of
type `Int` with all elements holding the QPU id.  In addition, the
`numQPUs()` function returns the number of QPUs that are executing the
kernel.  A QPU id will always lie in the range `0` to `numQPUs()-1`.

Now, to spread the `rot3D` computation accross multiple QPUs we will
use a loop increment of `16*numQPUs()` instead of `16`, and offset the
initial pointers `x` and `y` by `16*me()`.

```c++
void rot3D(Int n, Float cosTheta, Float sinTheta, Ptr<Float> x, Ptr<Float> y)
{
  Int inc = numQPUs() << 4;
  Ptr<Float> p = x + index() + (me() << 4);
  Ptr<Float> q = y + index() + (me() << 4);
  gather(p); gather(q);

  Float xOld, yOld;
  For (Int i = 0, i < n, i = i+inc)
    gather(p+inc); gather(q+inc);
    receive(xOld); receive(yOld);
    store(xOld * cosTheta - yOld * sinTheta, p);
    store(yOld * cosTheta + xOld * sinTheta, q);
    p = p+inc; q = q+inc;
  End

  // Discard pre-fetched vectors from final iteration
  receive(xOld); receive(yOld);
}
```

### Performance

Times taken to rotate an object with 192,000 vertices:

  Version  | Number of QPUs | Run-time (s) |
  ---------| -------------: | -----------: |
  Scalar   | 0              | 0.018        |
  Vector 1 | 1              | 0.040        |
  Vector 2 | 1              | 0.018        |
  Vector 3 | 1              | 0.018        |
  Vector 3 | 2              | 0.016        |

Non-blocking loads and stores (vector version 2) give a
significant performance boost: in this case a factor of 2.

Unforunately, the program does not scale well to multiple QPUs.  I'm
not entirely sure why, but my suspicion is that the compute-to-memory
ratio is too low: we do only 2 arithmetic operations for every memory
access, perhaps overwhelming the memory subsystem.  If there are
possibilities for QPULib to generate better code here, hopefully they
will be discovered in due course.  (Do let me know if you
have any suggestions.)

## Example 3: 2D Convolution (Heat Transfer)

Let's move to a somewhat more substantial example: modelling the heat
flow across a 2D surface.  [Newton's law of
cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_cooling)
states that an object cools at a rate proportional to the difference
between its temperature `T` and the temperature of its environment (or
ambient temperature) `A`:

```
dT/dt = −k(T − A)
```

When simulating this equation below, we will consider each point on
our 2D surface to be a seperate object, and the ambient temperature of
each object to be the average of the temperatures of the 8 surrounding
objects.  This is very similar to 2D convolution using a mean filter.

### Scalar version

The following function simulates a single time-step of the
differential equation, applied to each object in the 2D grid.

```c++
void step(float** grid, float** gridOut, int width, int height)
{
  for (int y = 1; y < height-1; y++) {
    for (int x = 1; x < width-1; x++) {
      float surroundings =
        grid[y-1][x-1] + grid[y-1][x]   + grid[y-1][x+1] +
        grid[y][x-1]   +                  grid[y][x+1]   +
        grid[y+1][x-1] + grid[y+1][x]   + grid[y+1][x+1];
      surroundings *= 0.125;
      gridOut[y][x] = grid[y][x] - (K * (grid[y][x] - surroundings));
    }
  }
}
```

If we apply heat at the north and east edges of our 2D surface, and
cold at the south and west edges, then after of several simulation
steps we get:

<img src="Doc/heat.png" alt="Heat flow across 2D surface" width=30%>

### Vector version

Before vectorising the simulation routine, we will introduce the idea
of a **cursor** which is useful for implementing sliding window
algorithms.  A cursor points to a window of three continguous vectors
in memory: `prev`, `current` and `next`.

```
  cursor  ------>  +---------+---------+---------+
                   |  prev   | current |  next   |
                   +---------+---------+---------+
                 +0:      +16:      +32:      +48:
```

and supports three main operations:

  1. **advance** the cursor by one vector, i.e. slide the window right
     by one vector;

  2. **shift-left** the `current` vector by one element,
     using the value of the `next` vector;

  3. **shift-right** the `current` vector by one element,
     using the value of the `prev` vector.

Here is a QPULib implementation of a cursor, using a C++ class.

```c++
class Cursor {
  Ptr<Float> cursor;
  Float prev, current, next;

 public:

  // Initialise to cursor to a given pointer
  // and fetch the first vector.
  void init(Ptr<Float> p) {
    gather(p);
    current = 0;
    cursor = p+16;
  }

  // Receive the first vector and fetch the second.
  // (prime the software pipeline)
  void prime() {
    receive(next);
    gather(cursor);
  }

  // Receive the next vector and fetch another.
  void advance() {
    cursor = cursor+16;
    prev = current;
    gather(cursor);
    current = next;
    receive(next);
  }

  // Receive final vector and don't fetch any more.
  void finish() {
    receive(next);
  }

  // Shift the current vector left one element
  void shiftLeft(Float& result) {
    result = rotate(current, 15);
    Float nextRot = rotate(next, 15);
    Where (index() == 15)
      result = nextRot;
    End
  }

  // Shift the current vector right one element
  void shiftRight(Float& result) {
    result = rotate(current, 1);
    Float prevRot = rotate(prev, 1);
    Where (index() == 0)
      result = prevRot;
    End
  }
};
```

Given a vector `x`, the QPULib operation `rotate(x, n)` will rotate
`x` right by `n` places where `n` is a integer in the range 0 to 15.
Notice that rotating right by 15 is the same as rotating left by 1.

Now, using cursors the vectorised simulation step is expressed below.
A slight structural difference from the scalar version is that we no
longer treat the grid as a 2D array: it is now 1D array with a `pitch`
parameter that gives the increment needed to get from the start of one
row to the start of the next.

```C++
void step(Ptr<Float> grid, Ptr<Float> gridOut, Int pitch, Int width, Int height)
{
  Cursor row[3];
  grid = grid + pitch*me() + index();

  // Skip first row of output grid
  gridOut = gridOut + pitch;

  For (Int y = me(), y < height, y=y+numQPUs())
    // Point p to the output row
    Ptr<Float> p = gridOut + y*pitch;

    // Initilaise three cursors for the three input rows
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) row[i].init(grid + i*pitch);
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) row[i].prime();

    // Compute one output row
    For (Int x = 0, x < width, x=x+16)

      for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) row[i].advance();

      Float left[3], right[3];
      for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        row[i].shiftLeft(right[i]);
        row[i].shiftRight(left[i]);
      }

      Float sum = left[0] + row[0].current + right[0] +
                  left[1] +                  right[1] +
                  left[2] + row[2].current + right[2];

      store(row[1].current - K * (row[1].current - sum * 0.125), p);
      p = p + 16;

    End

    // Cursors are finished for this row
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) row[i].finish();

    // Move to the next input rows
    grid = grid + pitch*numQPUs();
  End
}
```

### Performance

Times taken to simulate a 512x512 surface for 2000 steps:

  Version | Number of QPUs | Run-time (s) |
  --------| -------------: | -----------: |
  Scalar  | 0              | 431.46       |
  Vector  | 1              | 49.34        |
  Vector  | 2              | 24.91        |
  Vector  | 4              | 20.36        |

### Compiling

Compiling this project requires CMake (>=3.1).

  * git clone ${clone url}
  * cd QPULib
  * cmake
	* -DENABLE_QPU=ON will enable the QPU (rpi only)
	* -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON will build all examples in the Examples subdirectory
	* -DENABLE_DEBUG=ON will cause QPULib to compile with debug output to stdout
  * make
  * (optional) sudo make install # installs libraries and headers to CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/{lib,include}

This will create two directories, lib and bin, together with some CMake cache files. The examples, if enabled, are statically compiled and put into the bin directory, the lib directory contains both libqpu.a and libqpu.so for dynamic and static linking.

## References

The following works were *very* helpful in the development of
QPULib.
